# Chaotic Physics Sound Sequencer ðŸŽµ

A generative music playground where chaos meets melody. Create unpredictable soundscapes by dropping particles into a physics-driven environment. Watch and listen as gravity, collisions, and rebounds transform random motion into emergent musical patterns.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser
2. Click anywhere to begin
3. Drop particles and watch chaos unfold!

## Core Features
- **Chaotic Sound Generation** - Every collision creates unique melodic patterns
- **Physics-Driven Music** - Gravity and bounces influence the rhythm
- **Interactive Chaos** - Manipulate obstacles to shape the musical flow
- **Emergent Patterns** - Complex melodies from simple particle interactions

## Controls

**Mouse**
- Click/Space: Drop particle
- Drag: Move obstacles
- Double-click: Remove obstacle
- Scroll: Rotate obstacle

**Keyboard**
- 1-5: Drop multiple particles
- R: Randomize obstacles
- C: Clear all
- Arrow keys: Rotate selected

**UI Elements**
- Scale selector
- Gravity control
- Bounce adjustment

## Tips for Chaos
- Stack obstacles to create complex bounce patterns
- Adjust gravity for different musical densities
- Use multiple particles for layered chaos
- Experiment with bounce values for varied rhythms

## Tech Stack
